# Hydra Developer Recipes

Step-by-step guides for common Hydra development tasks. These recipes provide practical, hands-on instructions for extending Hydra, implementing new features, and working with Hydra's architecture.

## Available Recipes

### Core Development

- **[Extending Hydra Core](extending-hydra-core.md)** - Add new type and term constructors to Hydra Core. This guide documents the complete process including schema updates, type inference, rewriting functions, and solving the bootstrap problem.

### Implementations

- **[Creating a New Hydra Implementation](new-implementation.md)** - Complete 11-step guide for implementing Hydra in a new language

## About Recipes

Recipes are practical, task-oriented guides that walk through specific development scenarios. Each recipe includes:

- Clear prerequisites and context
- Step-by-step instructions
- Code examples and file locations
- Common pitfalls and troubleshooting tips
- Verification steps

These complement Hydra's reference documentation by focusing on "how to accomplish X" rather than "what is X."

## Contributing Recipes

Have a common development task that would make a good recipe? Contributions are welcome! Recipes should:

- Focus on a specific, well-defined task
- Include concrete examples from the Hydra codebase
- Provide complete, tested instructions
- Note any version-specific considerations

See the existing recipes for examples of structure and style.
