    The Serialization and Presentation properties of YAML,
    including directives, comments, anchors, style, formatting, and aliases, are not supported by this model.
    In addition, tags are omitted from this model, and non-standard scalars are unsupported.

              YAML allows for three special values, which are not supported here:
