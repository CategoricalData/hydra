-- | A GeoJSON model based on the specification at https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7946. This model provides some additional structure beyond the JSON encoding described in the specification; For example, it provides MultiPoint not as an object with an array of coordinates which encode points, but as an array of Points. A BoundingBox is not simply an list of numbers, but a list of CoordinateRanges.

-- | A GeoJSON object MAY have a member named "bbox" to include information on the coordinate range for its Geometries, Features, or FeatureCollections.

The axes order of a bbox follows the axes order of geometries.
