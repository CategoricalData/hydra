-- | An IANA link relation type
data LinkRelationType = 
  -- | Refers to a resource that is the subject of the link's context. [RFC6903], section 2

  -- | Used to reference alternative content that uses the AMP profile of the HTML format. [AMP HTML]
  LinkRelationTypeAmphtml  |
  -- | Refers to an appendix. [HTML 4.01 Specification]
  LinkRelationTypeAppendix  |
  -- | Refers to an icon for the context. Synonym for icon. [Configuring Web Applications]
  LinkRelationTypeApple_touch_icon  |
  -- | Refers to a launch screen for the context. [Configuring Web Applications]

  LinkRelationTypeArchives  |
  -- | Refers to the context's author. [HTML]
  LinkRelationTypeAuthor  |
  -- | Identifies the entity that blocks access to a resource following receipt of a legal demand. [RFC7725]
  LinkRelationTypeBlocked_by  |
  -- | Gives a permanent link to use for bookmarking purposes. [HTML]
  LinkRelationTypeBookmark  |
  -- | Designates the preferred version of a resource (the IRI and its contents). [RFC6596]
  LinkRelationTypeCanonical  |
  -- | Refers to a chapter in a collection of resources. [HTML 4.01 Specification]
  LinkRelationTypeChapter  |
  -- | Indicates that the link target is preferred over the link context for the purpose of permanent citation. [RFC8574]
  LinkRelationTypeCite_as  |
  -- | The target IRI points to a resource which represents the collection resource for the context IRI. [RFC6573]
  LinkRelationTypeCollection  |
  -- | Refers to a table of contents. [HTML 4.01 Specification]
  LinkRelationTypeContents  |
  -- | The document linked to was later converted to the document that contains this link relation. For example, an RFC can have a link to the Internet-Draft that became the RFC; in that case, the link relation would be "convertedFrom". [RFC7991] This relation is different than "predecessor-version" in that "predecessor-version" is for items in a version control system. It is also different than "previous" in that this relation is used for converted resources, not those that are part of a sequence of resources.
  LinkRelationTypeConvertedfrom  |
  -- | Refers to a copyright statement that applies to the link's context. [HTML 4.01 Specification]

  -- | Refers to a resource containing the most recent item(s) in a collection of resources. [RFC5005]
  LinkRelationTypeCurrent  |
  -- | Refers to a resource providing information about the link's context. [Protocol for Web Description Resources (POWDER)]
  LinkRelationTypeDescribedby  |
  -- | The relationship A 'describes' B asserts that resource A provides a description of resource B. There are no constraints on the format or representation of either A or B, neither are there any further constraints on either resource. [RFC6892] This link relation type is the inverse of the 'describedby' relation type. While 'describedby' establishes a relation from the described resource back to the resource that describes it, 'describes' established a relation from the describing resource to the resource it describes. If B is 'describedby' A, then A 'describes' B.
  LinkRelationTypeDescribes  |
  -- | Refers to a list of patent disclosures made with respect to material for which 'disclosure' relation is specified. [RFC6579]

  LinkRelationTypeDns_prefetch  |
  -- | Refers to a resource whose available representations are byte-for-byte identical with the corresponding representations of the context IRI. [RFC6249] This relation is for static resources. That is, an HTTP GET request on any duplicate will return the same representation. It does not make sense for dynamic or POSTable resources and should not be used for them.
  LinkRelationTypeDuplicate  |
  -- | Refers to a resource that can be used to edit the link's context. [RFC5023]
  LinkRelationTypeEdit  |
  -- | The target IRI points to a resource where a submission form for editing associated resource can be obtained. [RFC6861]

  LinkRelationTypeGlossary  |
  -- | Refers to context-sensitive help. [HTML]
  LinkRelationTypeHelp  |
  -- | Refers to a resource hosted by the server indicated by the link context. [RFC6690] This relation is used in CoRE where links are retrieved as a "/.well-known/core" resource representation, and is the default relation type in the CoRE Link Format.

  LinkRelationTypeLinkset  |
  -- | Refers to further information about the link's context, expressed as a LRDD ("Link-based Resource Descriptor Document") resource. See [RFC6415] for information about processing this relation type in host-meta documents. When used elsewhere, it refers to additional links and other metadata. Multiple instances indicate additional LRDD resources. LRDD resources MUST have an "application/xrd+xml" representation, and MAY have others. [RFC6415]
  LinkRelationTypeLrdd  |
  -- | Links to a manifest file for the context. [Web App Manifest]
  LinkRelationTypeManifest  |
  -- | Refers to a mask that can be applied to the icon for the context. [Creating Pinned Tab Icons]

  LinkRelationTypeP3pv1  |
  -- | Indicates a resource where payment is accepted. [RFC8288] This relation type registration did not indicate a reference. Requested by Joshua Kinberg and Robert Sayre. It is meant as a general way to facilitate acts of payment, and thus this specification makes no assumptions on the type of payment or transaction protocol. Examples may include a web page where donations are accepted or where goods and services are available for purchase. rel="payment" is not intended to initiate an automated transaction. In Atom documents, a link element with a rel="payment" attribute may exist at the feed/channel level and/or the entry/item level. For example, a rel="payment" link at the feed/channel level may point to a "tip jar" URI, whereas an entry/ item containing a book review may include a rel="payment" link that points to the location where the book may be purchased through an online retailer.

  LinkRelationTypeRestconf  |
  -- | Identifies a resource that is a reply to the context of the link. [RFC4685]
  LinkRelationTypeReplies  |
  -- | The resource identified by the link target provides an input value to an instance of a rule, where the resource which represents the rule instance is identified by the link context. [OCF Core Optional 2.2.0]
  LinkRelationTypeRuleinput  |
  -- | Refers to a resource that can be used to search through the link's context and related resources. [OpenSearch]

  LinkRelationTypeSponsored  |
  -- | Refers to the first resource in a collection of resources. [HTML 4.01 Specification]
  LinkRelationTypeStart  |
  -- | Identifies a resource that represents the context's status. [RFC8631]
  LinkRelationTypeStatus  |

  -- | Identifies a resource that is the source of the information in the link's context. [RFC4287]
  LinkRelationTypeVia  |
  -- | Identifies a target URI that supports the Webmention protocol. This allows clients that mention a resource in some form of publishing process to contact that endpoint and inform it that this resource has been mentioned. [Webmention] This is a similar "Linkback" mechanism to the ones of Refback, Trackback, and Pingback. It uses a different protocol, though, and thus should be discoverable through its own link relation type.
  LinkRelationTypeWebmention  |
  -- | Points to a working copy for this resource. [RFC5829]
