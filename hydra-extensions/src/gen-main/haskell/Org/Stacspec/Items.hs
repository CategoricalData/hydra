-- | STAC Items use a variety of rel types in the link object, to describe the exact nature of the link between this Item and the entity it is linking to. It is recommended to use the official IANA Link Relation Types where possible. The following table explains places where STAC use custom rel types are used with Items. This happens where there is not a clear official option, or where STAC uses an official type but adds additional meaning for the STAC context.

-- | The roles field is used to describe the purpose of each asset. It is recommended to include one for every asset, to give users a sense of why they might want to make use of the asset. There are some emerging standards that enable clients to take particular action when they encounter particular roles, listed below. But implementors are encouraged to come up with their own terms to describe the role.
data Role = 
  -- | An asset that represents a thumbnail of the Item, typically a true color image (for Items with assets in the visible wavelengths), lower-resolution (typically smaller 600x600 pixels), and typically a JPEG or PNG (suitable for display in a web browser). Multiple assets may have this purpose, but it recommended that the type and roles be unique tuples. For example, Sentinel-2 L2A provides thumbnail images in both JPEG and JPEG2000 formats, and would be distinguished by their media types.
  RoleThumbnail  |
  -- | An asset that represents a possibly larger view than the thumbnail of the Item, for example, a true color composite of multi-band data.
  RoleOverview  |
  -- | The data itself. This is a suggestion for a common role for data files to be used in case data providers don't come up with their own names and semantics.

  -- | A metadata sidecar file describing the data in this Item, for example the Landsat-8 MTL file.
