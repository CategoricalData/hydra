-- | A module for all tier-1 functions and constants. These are generated functions and constants which DSL functions and the implementations of primitive functions are allowed to depend upon. Higher tiers of generated code may not be depended upon, as these tiers may themselves need to depend on DSL functions or primitive functions.
