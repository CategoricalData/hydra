synopsis:     Graph programming language
description:  >
  Hydra is an implementation of the LambdaGraph data model, which takes advantage of an isomorphism
  between labeled hypergraphs and typed lambda calculus:
  in Hydra, "graphs are programs, and programs are graphs".
  The language is designed to be embedded in other programming languages -- currently Haskell, Java, and Python.
  Hydra transforms data, schemas, and functional programs into multiple other languages in a way which maintains type safety.
  It is self-hosting in Haskell -- it generates its own executable source code from Hydra sources -- and it is
  designed to become self-hosting in its other implementation languages, as well.
