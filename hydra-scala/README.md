# Hydra-Scala

Hydra is a data transformation toolkit which aims to be highly flexible and portable.
It has its roots in graph databases and type theory, and provides APIs in Haskell and Java.
See the main Hydra [README](https://github.com/CategoricalData/hydra) for more details.
This package contains Hydra's experimental Scala API and Scala sources specifically.

## Build

You can compile the Scala code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.
